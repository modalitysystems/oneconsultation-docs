# End User Browser Compatibility

OneConsultation has been designed to be both simple to user and accessible to as many people as possible.

There are **no plug-ins or client-side installations** needed to use OneConsultation.

Everything is accessible via a web-browser, using WebRTC technology for audio & video streaming.

Apart from an internet connection and a webcam there's no special equipment or software needed.
